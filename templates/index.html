        <p> I'm a Software Engineer that <strong>accelerates teams</strong> progress! In previous years, I focused on
          identifying and
          <strong>solving problems</strong> in the software development lifecycle.
          I've streamlined the development with <strong>preview deployments</strong> for every pull-request and improved
          the
          quality and stability of services by setting up user-friendly, observability stacks.
          All driven by highly automated processes!
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm implementing <strong>ChatOps</strong> practices, teaching the the 12-Factor-Principles and
          <strong>Kubernetes</strong> (as an Kubestronautâš“) while
          expanding my knowledge of different cloud provider
          technologies, to further improve <strong>automated</strong> resource provisioning, monitoring, and
          deployment concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love experimenting with different technologies and <strong>sharing my knowledge</strong> with others (check
          out my blog),
          even though if it
          might involve having an intense discussion with your favorite rubber duck<a
